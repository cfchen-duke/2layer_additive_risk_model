This repository contains the Python code for training and evaluating a two-layer additive risk model on the Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) dataset used in the 2018 Explainable Machine Learning Challenge (https://community.fico.com/s/explainable-machine-learning-challenge). Our team (Chaofan Chen, Kangcheng Lin, Cynthia Rudin, Yaron Shaposhnik, Sijia Wang, and Tong Wang) won the FICO Recognition Award (https://www.fico.com/en/newsroom/fico-announces-winners-inaugural-xml-challenge).
